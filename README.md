<h1>Tatakai</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  We here at Bubblegum Stu. present to you Tatakai (Fight!).Our game Tatakai is inspired from the game street fighter. In our game there will be two characters who are rivals. Each character will have different move sets and be able to use certain abilities when ready. Each character will be controlled by a player. The players will be using a keyboard to play the game. When a certain key is pressed on the keyboard the character will respond by doing the action(s) that is associated with that key. Each character will have the same amount of health at start, so when the character cannot take any more hits they will be knocked out (k.o.).Music will also be an aspect of the game to make the experience more enjoyable.
